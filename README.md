# Unit-9-Homework
This file contains 
and HTML file for UK Car Production and an HTML file for HON (Honeywell) Volatility Analysis
It should be noted that in the final 2 lines of the HON Vol Analysis displayed as
lines(volHONest2,type="l",col="red")

lines(volHONest3, type = "l", col="blue")
The code works, however, I had difficulties with Knitr in running these two pieces

The code is in the respository for both the UK Car Production and the HON Vol Analysis

The summary file contains basic answers to the questions posed in the exercise.
